# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This challenge was an on-the-job ticket that consisted of refactoring the existing code of a marketing agency called Horiseon.

The reason for refactoring was to both improve the website's search engine optimization ranking and its accessibility for disabled people using assistive technologies.

I was able to learn more about the default settings for many attributes, more detailed semantic language in HTML and CSS, and how to optimize selectors in CSS files for efficient viewing and use.
